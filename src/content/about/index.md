Hello! I'm Jean, I recently graduated from the [University of British Columbia](https://mtrl.ubc.ca/) with a Bachelors degree in Materials Engineering.
I specialised in materials manufacturing, design and performance and have work experience in both stainless steel casting R&D and as an undergraduate research assistant.
I have a very international background, having lived in 8 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.
This has given me the ability to thrive in different environments and work well with people of diverse cultures.

During my university career and respective work experiences, I have developed a strong understanding of microstructure engineering of high performance metal alloys (Cu Alloys, Al Alloys and Steels).
This includes microstructure modelling, analysis and manipulation all the way through to process design.

I aspire to apply my knowledge and experience of high performance materials to the Automotive or Aerospace industry and learn new skills everyday to ensure I stay ahead of technological developments in my area of expertise.
