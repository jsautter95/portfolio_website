- Assembled a variety of different electrodes used to collect electrochemical data on the reduction of chalcopyrite in sulfuric acid solution
- Collected and analyzed data in order to understand how sulfuric acid concentrations and the addition of cupric ions affect the reduction of chalcopyrite
- Meticulously worked along side a PhD student who taught me to use electrochemical analysis instruments and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis
